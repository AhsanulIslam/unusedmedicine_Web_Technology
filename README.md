# unusedmedicine_Web_Technology
This is a web-based management system that emphasizes on unused medicines (not expired) found in common residence. This System makes these medicines available where necessary i.e. Lower middle-class families who are having hard time getting such resources for various reason.

Background Study
We decided to produce this project based on several available services. The primary aspect of this project comes from non-profit organizations such as “Free clinic”, “Project HOPE”, “Health Leads”.

These organizations originally focus on low-income patients by providing them services at nominal price or for free.
One of the key feature of our project is the delivery system that we are inspired from various delivery systems such as “HungryNaki”,”Chaldal”,”FoodPanda’,”UberEats”,”PathaoFoods”. These online services are efficient at delivery of material in local areas.
